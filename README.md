# How do I install the new file?

**There is two ways you can add this to your game:**

## The better way: Balamod

1. **Close Balatro**
2. Install [UwUDev/balamod](https://github.com/UwUDev/balamod) as explained in their Readme
3. Download the 3 folders from this repo in `/balamod`
4. Put them into `%appdata%/Balatro`
5. You can now launch Balatro, select the english language and enjoy!

> This should work even when the game updates. If it doesn't, please open an Issue.

> **Important:** This only works with Balamod 0.1.9 which is not released as of now. You can build it from master though.
